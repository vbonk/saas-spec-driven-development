This document provides guidelines and best practices for implementing the web crawling and research process to create a comprehensive dataset for training AI coding agents.

## 1. Introduction

The objective of this process is to build a rich, structured, and detailed knowledge base about a software application. This knowledge base, in the form of a spreadsheet, will serve as the primary training data for AI coding agents, enabling them to understand the application deeply.

## 2. The Crawling Process

- **Start Broad:** Begin by crawling the entire website, including all subdomains, documentation portals, blogs, and marketing pages.
- **Recursive Crawling:** Use a recursive crawling strategy to follow all internal links and discover all available pages.
- **Prioritize High-Value Pages:** Pay special attention to pages that are likely to contain rich information, such as:
    -   Developer documentation
    -   API references
    -   Feature descriptions
    -   Pricing pages
    -   Case studies and use cases
    -   Design system documentation

## 3. Data Extraction and Analysis

- **Be Meticulous:** The quality of the dataset depends on the level of detail captured. Do not skim or summarize too early in the process.
- **Focus on the "Why":** When documenting features and functionalities, try to understand and capture the underlying purpose and user benefits.
- **Capture Everything:** When in doubt, capture the information. It is better to have too much data than too little. The `Raw Data` column is designed for this purpose.
- **Think Like an AI:** Consider what information an AI agent would need to understand a concept fully. This includes not just the "what" but also the "how" and the "why."

## 4. Using the Database Schema

- **Consistency is Key:** Use the defined categories and sub-categories consistently to ensure the dataset is well-organized and easy to query.
- **Create New Categories if Necessary:** While the provided schema is comprehensive, you may encounter information that does not fit neatly into the existing categories. In such cases, it is acceptable to create new, logical categories and sub-categories.
- **Use Descriptive Titles and Topics:** The `Title` and `Topic` columns are crucial for quickly identifying the content of each row. Make them as descriptive and specific as possible.

## 5. Populating the Spreadsheet

- **One Idea Per Row:** Each row in the spreadsheet should represent a single, atomic piece of information.
- **Avoid Duplication:** Before adding a new row, do a quick search to ensure the information has not already been captured.
- **Use Tags Effectively:** The `Identify Tags` column is a powerful tool for filtering and searching the dataset. Use a consistent tagging system and include relevant keywords.

## 6. Quality Assurance

- **Review and Refine:** After the initial data collection, review the spreadsheet for accuracy, consistency, and completeness.
- **Validate URLs:** Ensure that all URLs in the `Specific URL` column are valid and point to the correct page.
- **Check for Gaps:** Identify any gaps in the information and perform additional targeted research to fill them.

By following these guidelines, you can create a high-quality dataset that will be invaluable for training AI coding agents to understand and interact with software applications effectively.
