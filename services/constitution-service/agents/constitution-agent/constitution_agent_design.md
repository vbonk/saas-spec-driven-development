# Constitution Agent Design

## 1. Introduction

The Constitution Agent is a foundational component of the SaaS Architecture Spec-Kit (saasarch speckit) system. It is responsible for establishing, maintaining, and enforcing the guiding principles (the "Constitution") of the platform. This document outlines the design and architecture of the Constitution Agent.

## 2. Purpose and Scope

The primary purpose of the Constitution Agent is to ensure that all agents and services within the saasarch speckit ecosystem adhere to a predefined set of rules, standards, and architectural principles. This promotes consistency, quality, and predictability in the development and operation of AI-driven applications.

### Key Responsibilities:

*   **Constitution Management:** Define, store, and manage the Constitution of the platform.
*   **Principle Enforcement:** Enforce the principles of the Constitution across all agents and services.
*   **Compliance Auditing:** Regularly audit the system for compliance with the Constitution.
*   **Guidance and Education:** Provide guidance to developers and other agents on the principles of the Constitution.

## 3. Architecture

The Constitution Agent will be implemented as a Node.js/TypeScript microservice. It will expose a REST API for interaction with other agents and services. The agent will leverage a PostgreSQL database with the pgvector extension for storing and querying the Constitution's principles as vector embeddings.

### Components:

*   **REST API:** Provides endpoints for managing and querying the Constitution.
*   **Constitution Store:** A PostgreSQL database with pgvector for storing principles as text and vector embeddings.
*   **Enforcement Engine:** A module responsible for evaluating agent actions and system states against the Constitution.
*   **Auditing Module:** A component that periodically scans the system for compliance issues.

## 4. Data Model

The Constitution will be stored in a dedicated table in the PostgreSQL database. The schema will be as follows:

| Column        | Type          | Description                                      |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `id`          | `SERIAL`      | Primary key.                                     |
| `principle`   | `TEXT`        | The text of the constitutional principle.        |
| `embedding`   | `VECTOR`      | The vector embedding of the principle.           |
| `category`    | `VARCHAR(255)`| The category of the principle (e.g., 'security'). |
| `is_active`   | `BOOLEAN`     | Whether the principle is currently active.       |
| `created_at`  | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | The timestamp of when the principle was created. |
| `updated_at`  | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | The timestamp of when the principle was last updated. |

## 5. API Specification

The Constitution Agent will expose the following REST API endpoints:

*   `POST /principles`: Create a new constitutional principle.
*   `GET /principles`: Retrieve all constitutional principles.
*   `GET /principles/:id`: Retrieve a specific constitutional principle.
*   `PUT /principles/:id`: Update a constitutional principle.
*   `DELETE /principles/:id`: Deactivate a constitutional principle.
*   `POST /evaluate`: Evaluate an action or system state against the Constitution.

## 6. Implementation Details

The Constitution Agent will be developed using the following technologies:

*   **Runtime:** Node.js
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Framework:** Express
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL with pgvector
*   **ORM:** Prisma

## 7. Next Steps

1.  Set up the PostgreSQL database with the pgvector extension.
2.  Implement the Prisma schema for the Constitution data model.
3.  Develop the Node.js/TypeScript microservice with the Express framework.
4.  Implement the REST API endpoints for managing the Constitution.
5.  Develop the Enforcement Engine and Auditing Module.
6.  Write unit and integration tests for the Constitution Agent.
