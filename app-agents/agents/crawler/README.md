# Crawler Agent

## Overview

The Crawler Agent is a specialized agent designed to systematically crawl websites and extract detailed information about software applications. It uses a comprehensive research and analysis framework to build a structured knowledge base that can be used to train other AI agents.

## Features

- **Systematic Crawling**: Recursively crawls websites to discover and index all pages.
- **Information Extraction**: Extracts detailed information about software features, architecture, UI/UX, and more.
- **Structured Data Generation**: Populates a spreadsheet database with the extracted information, following a detailed schema.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Analyzes the extracted data to build a deep understanding of the software application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- `pandas` and `openpyxl` libraries

### Installation

1.  Clone the `app-agents` repository.
2.  Install the required Python libraries: `pip install pandas openpyxl`

### Configuration

- No specific configuration is required for the crawler agent itself. However, you will need to provide a list of target URLs to be crawled.

## Usage

To use the crawler agent, you will need to provide a list of target URLs and run the crawling and analysis process. The output will be a detailed spreadsheet containing the extracted information.

## Documentation

For more detailed documentation on the crawling system, please refer to the `docs/` directory within this agent's folder.
