# Agent-Builder: AI Agent Development Framework

**Agent-Builder** is a comprehensive, interactive framework designed to assist developers in building robust, reliable, and well-documented AI agents. It incorporates the latest best practices from leading AI research organizations including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and the open-source community.

## Overview

The Agent-Builder is not just a collection of tools; it is an active agent that collaborates with you to design, scaffold, test, and document new AI agents. It ensures that your agents are built on a foundation of proven architectural patterns and safety principles.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Development**: Conversational interface guides you through agent creation
- **Best Practices by Default**: Embeds proven patterns from industry leaders
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Built-in TDD framework for reliable agents
- **Documentation-First**: Automatic generation and maintenance of `agents.md` files
- **Modular Architecture**: Simple, composable patterns over complex frameworks

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize a new agent project
agent-builder new-agent

# Design your agent interactively
agent-builder design-agent

# Generate project structure
agent-builder scaffold-project

# Add tools to your agent
agent-builder add-tool

# Run tests
agent-builder run-tests
```

## Architecture

The Agent-Builder follows a modular architecture with the following components:

- **Conversational Interface**: LLM-powered guidance system
- **Knowledge Base**: Curated best practices from authoritative sources
- **Project Scaffolding Engine**: Generates complete project structures
- **Tool Management System**: Helps define and document agent tools
- **Testing Framework**: Integrated TDD support
- **Documentation Generator**: Maintains up-to-date documentation
