## Document Structure Analysis
The guide appears to be a 34-page comprehensive document covering:
1. Foundational concepts and definitions
2. Decision framework for when to build agents
3. Core design principles and foundations
4. Safety and guardrails implementation
5. Practical conclusions and recommendations

This structure suggests a methodical approach from concept to implementation with strong emphasis on safety considerations.

## Introduction Section Key Points

**Core Definition**: Large language models are becoming increasingly capable of handling complex, multi-step tasks. Advances in reasoning, multimodality, and tool use have unlocked a new category of LLM-powered systems known as **agents**.

**Guide Purpose**: Designed for product and engineering teams exploring how to build their first agents, distilling insights from numerous customer deployments into practical and actionable best practices.

**Guide Coverage**: 
- Frameworks for identifying promising use cases
- Clear patterns for designing agent logic and orchestration
- Best practices to ensure agents run safely, predictably, and effectively

**Expected Outcome**: After reading this guide, teams will have the foundational knowledge needed to confidently start building their first agent.

**Key Insight**: The guide emphasizes practical, deployment-tested approaches rather than theoretical concepts, based on real customer implementations.

## What is an Agent? (OpenAI Definition)

**Core Distinction**: While conventional software enables users to streamline and automate workflows, agents are able to perform the same workflows on the users' behalf with a high degree of independence.

**Key Definition**: 
> "Agents are systems that **independently** accomplish tasks on your behalf."

**Workflow Context**: A workflow is a sequence of steps that must be executed to meet the user's goal, whether that's resolving a customer service issue, booking a restaurant reservation, committing a code change, or generating a report.

**What Are NOT Agents**: Applications that integrate LLMs but don't use them to control workflow execution—think simple chatbots, single-turn LLMs, or sentiment classifiers—are not agents.

**Core Agent Characteristics**: An agent possesses core characteristics that allow it to act reliably and consistently on behalf of a user:

1. **Leverages an LLM to manage workflow execution and make decisions** - It recognizes when to take action and what action to take based on the current state and context.
