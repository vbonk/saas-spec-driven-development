Analyzes user requirements and identifies areas needing clarification.

**Parameters:**
- `prompt` (str): User's initial design request

**Returns:**
- Dictionary containing extracted information, missing details, clarifying questions, and completeness score

**Example:**
```python
analysis = agent.analyze_prompt("I need a dashboard for analytics")
# Returns: {
#   "extracted_information": {...},
#   "missing_information": [...],
#   "clarifying_questions": [...],
#   "completeness_score": 0.4,
#   "ready_for_recommendations": false
# }
```

### `get_design_recommendations(refined_prompt: dict) -> dict`

Generates comprehensive design recommendations based on refined requirements.

**Parameters:**
- `refined_prompt` (dict): Structured requirements with project details

**Returns:**
- Dictionary containing recommendations, predicted scores, and implementation guidance

**Example:**
```python
recommendations = agent.get_design_recommendations({
    "project_type": "dashboard",
    "target_audience": "analysts",
    "platform": "web",
    "key_features": ["charts", "filters", "reports"]
})
```

### `generate_component_code(component: str, framework: str) -> str`

Creates boilerplate code for UI components.

**Parameters:**
- `component` (str): Component type (button, modal, table, etc.)
- `framework` (str): Target framework (react, vue, svelte, etc.)

**Returns:**
- Generated code string with TypeScript interfaces and accessibility features

**Example:**
```python
code = agent.generate_component_code("button", "react")
# Returns complete React component with TypeScript and accessibility
```

### `audit_accessibility(design_spec: dict) -> dict`

Evaluates design specifications for accessibility compliance.

**Parameters:**
- `design_spec` (dict): Design specification including colors, navigation, and interaction patterns

**Returns:**
- Audit results with compliance score, issues, and recommendations

**Example:**
```python
audit = agent.audit_accessibility({
    "colors": {"primary": "#007bff", "background": "#ffffff"},
    "navigation": {"keyboard_accessible": true}
})
```

### `suggest_dataviz(data_description: str) -> dict`

Recommends appropriate data visualization types.

**Parameters:**
- `data_description` (str): Description of data to be visualized

**Returns:**
- Visualization recommendations with rationale and implementation notes

**Example:**
```python
suggestions = agent.suggest_dataviz("Sales trends over 12 months")
# Returns: {"primary_recommendation": {"type": "Line Chart", ...}}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Design Consultation

```python
from ui_architect_agent import UIArchitectAgent

# Initialize agent
agent = UIArchitectAgent()

# Start with high-level requirements
prompt = "I need to design a project management dashboard"
analysis = agent.analyze_prompt(prompt)

# Review clarifying questions
print("Questions to consider:")
for question in analysis["clarifying_questions"]:
    print(f"- {question}")

# Provide detailed requirements
requirements = {
    "project_type": "dashboard",
    "target_audience": "project managers",
    "platform": "web",
    "key_features": ["task tracking", "team collaboration", "reporting"],
    "business_goals": ["improve productivity", "enhance visibility"],
    "design_style": "modern professional",
    "constraints": ["mobile responsive", "accessibility compliant"]
}

# Get comprehensive recommendations
recommendations = agent.get_design_recommendations(requirements)

# Generate component code
button_code = agent.generate_component_code("button", "react")
modal_code = agent.generate_component_code("modal", "react")
```

### Accessibility-First Design Process

```python
# Define design specification
design_spec = {
    "colors": {
        "primary": "#0066cc",
        "secondary": "#6c757d",
        "background": "#ffffff",
        "text": "#212529"
    },
    "navigation": {
        "keyboard_accessible": True,
        "screen_reader_support": True
    },
    "typography": {
        "base_size": "16px",
        "line_height": "1.5"
    }
}

# Audit for accessibility compliance
audit_results = agent.audit_accessibility(design_spec)

print(f"Accessibility Score: {audit_results['overall_score']:.2f}")
print(f"Compliance Level: {audit_results['compliance_level']}")

# Address any issues found
for issue in audit_results['issues']:
    print(f"Issue: {issue['description']}")
    print(f"Recommendation: {issue['recommendation']}")
```

### Data Visualization Guidance

```python
# Get visualization recommendations for different data types
time_series = agent.suggest_dataviz("User engagement metrics over 6 months")
categorical = agent.suggest_dataviz("Revenue breakdown by product category")
proportional = agent.suggest_dataviz("Market share distribution among competitors")

# Each returns specific chart recommendations with implementation guidance
print(f"Time series: {time_series['primary_recommendation']['type']}")
print(f"Categorical: {categorical['primary_recommendation']['type']}")
print(f"Proportional: {proportional['primary_recommendation']['type']}")
```

## Knowledge Base
