- **Description**: The UI-Architect-Agent is a sophisticated AI assistant that provides expert guidance on modern UI/UX design principles, patterns, and best practices. Built on comprehensive research from industry leaders including Material Design, Nielsen Norman Group, and leading design publications, it evaluates designs across eight critical dimensions and provides evidence-based recommendations for creating effective user interfaces.
- **Special Functions**:
  - Interactive Prompt Refinement: Engages users in dialogue to clarify requirements and ensure comprehensive understanding of design challenges
  - Multi-dimensional Design Analysis: Evaluates proposals against Sentiment, Usability, Aesthetics, Value, Accuracy, Utility, Form, and Function dimensions
  - Evidence-Based Recommendations: Provides specific guidance based on curated knowledge base of modern UI/UX principles
  - Component Code Generation: Creates production-ready boilerplate code for common UI components in popular frameworks
  - Accessibility Auditing: Evaluates designs for WCAG compliance and inclusive design practices
  - Data Visualization Guidance: Recommends appropriate chart types and visualization patterns based on data characteristics
- **Dataset(s)**:
  - `ui_ux_research_dataset.xlsx` (XLSX) - Comprehensive research database
- **Use Cases**: Interface design, User experience optimization, Accessibility auditing, System design, Architecture planning

## ðŸŽ¯ Agent Categories

Our agents are organized into specialized categories:

| Category | Agents | Focus Area |
|----------|--------|------------|
| **Research & Analysis** | Crawler, Ui Architect Agent | Web crawling, data extraction, competitive analysis |
| **Design & UX** | Agent Builder | Interface design, user experience, accessibility |
| **Development** | *Coming Soon* | Code generation, architecture guidance, testing |
| **Content & Communication** | *Coming Soon* | Content creation, documentation, technical writing |
## ðŸ“Š Agent Performance Metrics

Each agent includes comprehensive performance tracking:

- **Recommendation Accuracy**: How well suggestions align with user needs and industry standards
- **Implementation Success**: Percentage of generated outputs that work without modification  
- **Domain Expertise**: Depth and breadth of knowledge in specialized areas
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback scores on recommendation quality and usefulness
- **Compliance Standards**: Adherence to accessibility, security, and best practice guidelines

## Getting Started

To create a new agent, follow these steps:

1.  **Create a new directory** for your agent under the `agents/` directory.
2.  **Follow the recommended directory structure** within your agent's directory (`src/`, `docs/`, `config/`).
3.  **Develop your agent's source code** in the `src/` directory.
4.  **Add agent-specific documentation** in the `docs/` directory.
5.  **Add any necessary configuration files** in the `config/` directory.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome. Please follow these guidelines:

*   **Create an issue** to discuss any major changes or new features.
*   **Follow the existing coding style** and conventions.
*   **Write clear and concise commit messages**.
*   **Update the documentation** as needed.

## Shared Resources

The `shared/` directory contains resources that can be used by all agents. This includes:

*   **Tools**: Common scripts and utilities that can be used for tasks such as data processing, API interaction, and more.
*   **Configs**: Shared configuration files, such as logging configurations or API client settings.
*   **Schemas**: Data schemas that define the structure of data used by the agents.

By using these shared resources, you can reduce code duplication and ensure consistency across all agents.
