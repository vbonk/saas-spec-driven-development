# Web Crawling and Research Prompt Template

**Objective:** To conduct a comprehensive analysis of a software application's website(s) and create a detailed dataset for training AI coding agents.

**Target Website(s):** [List of URLs to be crawled]

**Crawling and Research Instructions:**

1.  **Crawl:** Systematically crawl all pages of the target website(s). This includes following all internal links to discover and index every page.

2.  **Analyze:** For each crawled page, analyze the content to identify and extract the following information. Use the specified database schema to structure the extracted data.

3.  **Extract:** Capture the following information for each identified feature, function, use case, and other relevant aspects of the software:

    *   **Category:** The main category of the information (e.g., Features, Architecture, UI/UX).
    *   **Sub-category:** A more specific sub-category (e.g., Core Features, Integrations, Design System).
    *   **Title:** A concise title for the information being described.
    *   **Topic:** The specific topic being addressed (e.g., User Authentication, API Documentation, Color Palette).
    *   **Detail:** A detailed description of the information, including its purpose, functionality, and any relevant technical details.
    *   **Specific URL:** The exact URL where the information was found (for citation and reference).
    *   **Identify Tags:** Relevant keywords or tags that describe the information (e.g., #frontend, #API, #security).
    *   **Summary:** A brief summary of the information.
    *   **Raw Data:** The raw HTML or text content from which the information was extracted.

4.  **Populate Database:** Populate the spreadsheet database with the extracted information, ensuring that each piece of data is placed in the correct column.

**Overarching Goal:** The ultimate goal is to create a dataset that provides a deep and comprehensive understanding of the software application. This dataset will be used to train AI coding agents to assist in the development, maintenance, and enhancement of the application. Therefore, it is crucial to be as detailed and thorough as possible in the data collection and analysis process.
