# Implementation Tasks: SaaS Spec-Driven Development Platform

**Tasks Version**: 1.0  
**Created**: September 20, 2025  
**Status**: Ready for Execution  
**Methodology**: Agentic Development with Human Oversight

## Task Classification Framework

### Effort Type Classification
**Agentic Tasks** represent work that can be effectively completed by AI agents with minimal human oversight. These tasks typically involve code generation, documentation creation, configuration setup, and routine implementation following established patterns.

**Human Tasks** require human judgment, strategic decision-making, or complex problem-solving that benefits from human expertise. These tasks include architectural decisions, stakeholder communication, and quality validation.

**Collaborative Tasks** benefit from human-AI collaboration where AI agents handle routine implementation while humans provide guidance, validation, and strategic oversight.

### Priority Classification
**P0 (Critical)** tasks are essential for MVP functionality and must be completed before any dependent tasks can begin. These tasks represent core platform capabilities without which the system cannot function.

**P1 (High)** tasks are important for complete functionality but can be implemented after P0 tasks are complete. These tasks enhance the platform but are not blocking for basic operation.

**P2 (Medium)** tasks improve user experience and platform capabilities but can be deferred if necessary. These tasks represent enhancements and optimizations.

**P3 (Low)** tasks are nice-to-have features that can be implemented in future iterations. These tasks represent advanced features and optimizations.
