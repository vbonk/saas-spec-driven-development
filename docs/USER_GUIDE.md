## Creating Your First Application

Let's walk through creating a complete application using the platform. We'll build a "Task Management API" that demonstrates all five phases.

### Step 1: Constitution Phase

**Access the Constitution Service**
Navigate to "New Project" in your dashboard and select "Create Constitution." The platform provides templates for common application types.

**Define Project Principles**
```yaml
# Example Constitution for Task Management API
project_name: "Task Management API"
architecture_style: "RESTful microservices"
security_level: "enterprise"
performance_target: "sub-200ms response times"
scalability_requirement: "horizontal scaling to 10,000 concurrent users"
compliance_standards: ["SOC2", "GDPR"]
```

**Establish Development Guidelines**
- All endpoints must include comprehensive input validation
- Database operations must use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- All responses must follow consistent JSON structure with proper error handling
- Code must achieve 90% test coverage before deployment approval

**Platform Validation**
The Constitution Service automatically validates your constitution against organizational standards and identifies potential conflicts or missing requirements.

### Step 2: Specification Phase

**Create Functional Requirements**
Use the Specification Service to define what your Task Management API will do:

```markdown
# Task Management API Specification

## Core Functionality
- Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks
- Tasks have title, description, due date, priority, and status
- Users can organize tasks into projects and categories
- System supports task assignment and collaboration

## API Endpoints
- POST /api/tasks - Create new task
- GET /api/tasks - List tasks with filtering and pagination
- GET /api/tasks/{id} - Retrieve specific task
- PUT /api/tasks/{id} - Update existing task
- DELETE /api/tasks/{id} - Remove task

## Data Model
Task {
  id: UUID (auto-generated)
  title: string (required, max 200 chars)
  description: string (optional, max 2000 chars)
  due_date: ISO 8601 datetime (optional)
  priority: enum ["low", "medium", "high", "urgent"]
  status: enum ["todo", "in_progress", "completed", "cancelled"]
  created_at: ISO 8601 datetime (auto-generated)
  updated_at: ISO 8601 datetime (auto-updated)
}
```

**AI-Assisted Enhancement**
The platform's AI agents analyze your specification and suggest improvements:
- "Consider adding user authentication and authorization requirements"
- "Specify rate limiting policies for API endpoints"
- "Define error response formats and HTTP status codes"
- "Add pagination parameters for list endpoints"

**Quality Validation**
The Specification Service provides quality scores:
- **Completeness**: 85% (missing authentication details)
- **Clarity**: 92% (well-defined data structures)
- **Testability**: 88% (clear acceptance criteria)
- **Consistency**: 95% (aligns with organizational patterns)

### Step 3: Planning Phase

**Technical Architecture Design**
The Planning Service coordinates multiple AI agents to create your technical plan:

```yaml
# Technical Plan for Task Management API

## Architecture
- Node.js with Express.js framework
- PostgreSQL database with connection pooling
- Redis for caching and session management
- Docker containerization for deployment

## Database Schema
- tasks table with proper indexing

### Step 5: Implementation Phase

**Coordinated Execution**
The Implementation Service orchestrates AI agents to execute your tasks:

**Task 1: Database Setup**
```sql
-- Generated by Cursor with human oversight
CREATE TABLE tasks (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    due_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    priority task_priority_enum NOT NULL DEFAULT 'medium',
    status task_status_enum NOT NULL DEFAULT 'todo',
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_user_id ON tasks(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_status ON tasks(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_due_date ON tasks(due_date);
```

**Task 2: Authentication Implementation**
```javascript
// Generated by Claude Code with security focus
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

class AuthService {
    async authenticateUser(email, password) {
        const user = await User.findByEmail(email);
        if (!user || !await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password_hash)) {
            throw new AuthenticationError('Invalid credentials');
        }
        
        const token = jwt.sign(
            { userId: user.id, email: user.email },
            process.env.JWT_SECRET,
            { expiresIn: '24h' }
        );
        
        return { user, token };
    }
}
```

**Quality Assurance Integration**
Throughout implementation, the platform continuously validates against your constitution:
- Code quality checks ensure 90% test coverage requirement
- Security scans validate against enterprise security standards
- Performance tests confirm sub-200ms response time targets
- Integration tests verify API contract compliance
